In this project, I build a web app where there is a text area, as we start to type like we will say choose one and we'll see it'll format down is like a tag. And to create another tag, just need to put a comma and start to type again, and soon as I hit enter, it's going to give us a cool effect and it's going to stop on a random choice.
